-----------------Errors!-----------------

The database did not save my first round when I joined the game and was spectating.

The database did not save my secound round when I did play. The round exist but only names where saved.

MAKE SURE THAT YOU RUN THE ROSTER AT THE END OF THE ROUND AND SAVE IT TO THE DATABASE! NOT AFTER THE GAME.
